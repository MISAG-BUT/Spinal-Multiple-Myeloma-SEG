# Spinal-Multiple-Myeloma-SEG

## Overview
Welcome to the repository for the paper **"Spinal-Multiple-Myeloma-SEG"**! This repository provides the code for the implementation of the networks for segmentation within the popular [nnUNet framework](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet).

The repository contains two main scripts:  
1. A script for visualizing the dataset, allowing you to explore the spinal and myeloma images used.  
2. A script for performing segmentation predictions on the spine and myeloma regions. These predictions were utilized to create the myeloma database used in the study.  

Together, these scripts allow researchers to reproduce the dataset preparation and segmentation workflows described in the paper.

## Trained Models / Zenodo
Pre-trained nnU-Net models for this project are available on Zenodo. These models were trained for segmentation of spine, vertebrae, and osteolytic spinal multiple myeloma lesions in dual-energy CT data.

- The models were created as part of the dataset preparation and annotation pipeline for **Spinal-Multiple-Myeloma-SEG**, released via [The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)](https://doi.org/10.7937/k4qv-hh78).
- Spine and vertebrae segmentation models were trained on **conventional CT data** from the VerSe2020 dataset, as well as on a combined VerSe2020 + multiple myeloma dataset. These masks were used to localize the spinal region and define spatial cropping for downstream lesion segmentation.
- Lesion segmentation models were trained exclusively on **VMI 40 keV images** using an iterative semi-automatic annotation workflow.
- All models operate on **NIfTI (.nii.gz)** inputs and are intended for **research and development purposes only**.

## Usage
### Installation

#### Environment Setup for nnUNet Prediction (Python 3.13)
This guide explains how to set up the environment for running predictions with [nnUNet](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet) on the [Spinal-Multiple-Myeloma-SEG](https://github.com/MISAG-BUT/Spinal-Multiple-Myeloma-SEG) project.
Check out the official [nnUNet installation instructions](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet/blob/master/documentation/installation_instructions.md)

**Note:** This pipeline has been tested on both Linux and Windows systems with GPUs:  

- **Linux:**  
  - GPU: Nvidia Titan Xp, 12 GB GDDR5  
  - CPU: Intel Core i9-12900KF, 8+8/24 cores/threads, 2.4/3.2 GHz  
  - RAM: 64 GB DDR5  
  - Storage: 1 TB SSD (system), 4 TB HDD RAID5 (data)  
  - OS: Ubuntu 24.04  

- **Windows:**  
  - GPU: EVGA GeForce RTX 3090, 24 GB GDDR6  
  - CPU: Intel Core i9-10900KF, 10/20 cores/threads, 3.7 GHz  
  - RAM: 64 GB  
  - Storage: 2 TB SSD M.2 (system)  
  - OS: Windows 10  

> ⚠ **Important:** The script defaults to Linux-style multiprocessing. On a clean Windows setup, nnU-Net batch prediction may fail due to multiprocessing issues.  
> If segmentation fails, use **Variant 2** in the `run_nnunet_inference` function in `utils.py`, which runs predictions sequentially without multiprocessing. This is slower but safe on Windows.

#### Step 1: Install Python and Clone Repository
First, download and install Python 3.13.x from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). We used Python 3.13.5.  
During installation, make sure to check **"Add Python to PATH"**.  


Create a virtual environment inside the project folder. Replace <path-to-your-python-executable> with the path to Python 3.13 on your system:
```bash
<path-to-your-python-executable> -m venv venv_run_nnUNet_prediction
```

Examples:
- Windows
```bash
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\python.exe -m venv venv_run_nnUNet_prediction
```
- Linux/macOS
```bash
python3.13 -m venv venv_run_nnUNet_prediction
```

Activate the environment:
- Windows
```bash
venv_run_nnUNet_prediction\Scripts\activate
```
- Linux/macOS
```bash
source venv_run_nnUNet_prediction/bin/activate
```

When activated, your prompt should show (venv_run_nnUNet_prediction).

#### Step 2: Install Core Dependencies
Install required packages starting with PyTorch. For CUDA 12.6 run:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
```
Clone the nnUNet repository, move into it, and install in editable mode:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet.git
cd nnUNet
pip install -e .
cd ..
```

Clone the project repository and move into the project folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MISAG-BUT/Spinal-Multiple-Myeloma-SEG.git
cd Spinal-Multiple-Myeloma-SEG
pip install -e .
cd ..
```

#### Step 3: Additional / Optional  Packages
Install additional required packages:
> 💡 **Tip:** Depending on your Linux setup, you may need system libraries for `napari`/Qt to run (e.g., `libxcb-xinerama0`). Install only what you need.
```bash
# DICOM support
pip install pydicom
# Napari viewer for GUI visualization
pip install napari
# Full napari installation with all optional plugins
pip install -U 'napari[all]'
```

#### Full Setup Summary
For convenience, a full setup summary:
```bash
<path-to-your-python-executable> -m venv venv_run_nnUNet_prediction
# Activate the environment
# Windows:
venv_run_nnUNet_prediction\Scripts\activate
# Linux/macOS:
source venv_run_nnUNet_prediction/bin/activate

pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
git clone https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet.git
cd nnUNet
pip install -e .
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/MISAG-BUT/Spinal-Multiple-Myeloma-SEG.git
cd Spinal-Multiple-Myeloma-SEG
pip install -e .
cd ..

# Optional / additional packages
pip install pydicom napari
pip install -U 'napari[all]'
```

Always replace <path-to-your-python-executable> with the correct path on your system. For different CUDA versions or CPU-only setups, check the [PyTorch installation guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

Running the Pipeline / Inference
===============================

This repository provides two complementary ways of working with the
Spinal-Multiple-Myeloma-SEG data:

1. Data visualization and qualitative inspection using Python scripts (recommended first step)
2. Full nnU-Net–based segmentation pipeline for automatic inference
3. Optional command-line inference using the default nnU-Net CLI


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Visualization and Inspection
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Visualization Script
--------------------
**`Database_viewer_final.py`**

This script is intended for qualitative inspection of the dataset and segmentation
results. It loads multiple CT reconstructions from DICOM data, overlays spine and
lesion segmentation masks, and visualizes everything using **Napari**.

The script can be executed both:
- directly from the command line, and
- interactively from an IDE such as VS Code.


Loaded Data
-----------
For a selected patient, the script automatically detects and loads the following
DICOM series based on the SeriesDescription metadata:

- Conventional CT (ConvCT)
- Virtual Monoenergetic Images (VMI):
  - 40 keV
  - 80 keV
  - 120 keV
- Calcium Suppression reconstructions:
  - 25 Index
  - 50 Index
  - 75 Index
  - 100 Index

In addition, the script loads segmentation masks in **NIfTI (.nii.gz)** format:

- Spine segmentation mask
- Osteolytic lesion segmentation mask


Visualization Features
----------------------
All volumes and segmentation masks are displayed together in a single Napari viewer:

- CT volumes are shown as grayscale image layers
- Spine segmentation is overlaid in blue
- Lesion segmentation is overlaid in red
- Individual layers can be toggled on/off for interactive comparison
- Opacity and visibility can be adjusted directly in Napari

This setup enables detailed visual comparison between different energy reconstructions
and segmentation outputs.


Running the Visualization Script from the Command Line
-----------------------------------------------------
The visualization script uses argparse and can be executed directly from the command
line by specifying only the required paths and patient ID:
```bash
python Database_viewer_final.py \
  --path_to_DICOM_folders /path/to/MM_DICOM_Dataset \
  --path_to_segmentations /path/to/MM_NIfTI_Segmentation \
  --ID_patient S840
```
Arguments:
- --path_to_DICOM_folders
  Path to the DICOM folders, which are organized by patient ID and then by series description

- --path_to_segmentations
  Path to the NIfTI segmentation masks, which are organized by patient ID and mask type
  (spine or lesions)

- --ID_patient
  Patient identifier (e.g. S840)


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Full Segmentation Pipeline (Python)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Segmentation Script
-------------------
**`run_prediction_of_nnUNet_networks_on_TCIA_data_final.py`**

This script runs the complete nnU-Net–based segmentation pipeline for a single patient,
starting directly from DICOM data and producing final lesion segmentations in the
original image space.

The pipeline always starts from a clean working directory to ensure reproducibility.
Any existing intermediate results for the selected patient are removed before processing.


Pipeline Steps
--------------
1. Conversion of ConvCT and VMI 40 keV DICOM series to NIfTI format
2. Spine segmentation from ConvCT data using nnU-Net
3. Reorientation of the spine segmentation back to the original image space
4. Lesion segmentation from VMI 40 keV images
5. Final reconstruction of lesion segmentation in the original image space


Running the Segmentation Pipeline
--------------------------------
The segmentation script can be executed from the command line using its argparse interface:
```bash
python run_prediction_of_nnUNet_networks_on_TCIA_data_final.py \
  --path_to_DICOM_folders /path/to/MM_DICOM_Dataset \
  --nnUNet_results /path/to/nnUNet_trained_models \
  --ID_patient S840 \
  --split_data True
```
Arguments:
- --path_to_DICOM_folders
  Path to the DICOM folders organized by patient ID and series description

- --nnUNet_results
  Path to the folder containing trained nnU-Net models

- --ID_patient
  Patient identifier (e.g. S840)

- --split_data
  If True, data are split along the Z-axis to reduce memory requirements

Notes on Multiprocessing
------------------------
- By default, the pipeline is configured for **Linux** and may use multiprocessing during nnU-Net inference.
- On **Windows**, Python multiprocessing can occasionally fail when running from a clean session.
- If inference fails on Windows, open `utils.py` and modify the function `run_nnunet_inference` to use **variant 2** (`predict_from_files_sequential`), which disables multiprocessing.
- This variant is slower but ensures safe and stable execution on Windows systems.

### Command-Line Inference Using nnUNet
The trained models can also be used with the default nnU-Net CLI for folder-based inference. For inference you can use the default [nnUNet inference functionalities](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet/blob/master/documentation/how_to_use_nnunet.md). 

To run a single model on all input images:

```bash
nnUNetv2_predict_from_modelfolder -i INPUT_FOLDER -o OUTPUT_FOLDER -m MODEL_FOLDER -f all
```
